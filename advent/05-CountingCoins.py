# Advent Challenge 5 - Counting Coins
# Write a script which, when given a positive integer, will tell you how many
# different ways there are, in British coinage, to make that amount in pence.
# e.g. python 05-CountingCoins.py 500 would return the number of different ways
# you can make 500p = Â£5 in standard British coinage.
